# AI-Explorations

A series of AI Experiments

This project is intended to be an "in the open" exploration of AI as I learn it.

I have a long term goal of growing food end to end fully autonomously and I would
like to use this experiments to both showcase my skills and abilities and
make incremental progress towards this goal.

Feel free to read/review/copy/explore anything you want. My goal is to simply learn and
grow. However, I would be delighted if it helps you in any way.

Brutal honesty: there may be better ways of doing these things. My primary goal here
is to learn even if this means making sub-optimal decisions from time to time.
This comes from a deep unease watching
the world of AI take of and feeling like I'm watching it happen vs taking control and doing something
with it. I can't control what I don't know but can promise everything I learn will be shared here
and that I am relatively certain I will get better over time.

## Repo Organization

This repo is going to be a "sort of" Monorepo.
Every directory should be a self-contained experiment and, as such, should contain

* A README
* Some way to recreate the environment
* Some code/binaries/etc
